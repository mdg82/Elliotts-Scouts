                      <h2><strong>Federal Militia</strong></h2>
                    <h4><strong>Historical Information</strong></h4>
                        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
                        <p>In studying the Civil War in Missouri nothing is more confusing than sorting out the various hodge-podge of militia units that fought on the
                        Federal side. A general statement regarding a generic militia unit in a military report, newspaper article, diary, magazine, book, etc., should
                        rightly leave the reader scratching his or her head. The following listing, while not necessarily complete, provides brief profiles of the most
                        prominent militia organizations that existed in Missouri during the War Between the States.</p>
                       
                       <p><strong>1. Home Guard 1861</strong></p>
                       <p>On June 11, 1861, the commander of the Department of the West, Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon, was ordered by the Department of War to enlist
                       <em>&#34;such loyal citizens&#34;</em> of Missouri as he thought proper to allow those individuals to protect their homes and neighborhoods from the state&#39;s
                       pro-Southern element. With the formational authority being provided by the United States government as opposed to the secessionist state government,
                       this national-level involvement in localized community defense efforts was unique in the course of the Civil War. Just under 20,000 men served in
                       what came to be known as the Home Guard, filling a total of 241 companies in 6 regiments and 22 battalions. According to a post-war Congressional
                       report on the various military organizations that were created in Missouri, <em>&#34;the Home Guard consisted of two classes:&#34;</em>(1) Those who were
                       organized for their own protection and the preservation of peace in their own neighborhoods, and were armed by the United States but were to receive
                       neither pay, clothing, nor rations, and,<em>&#34;(2) Those who were organized, armed, and equipped for more active local service, for which service it
                       was understood they would have a valid claim for pay.&#34;</em> These latter units were called into service by Federal military authorities in Missouri
                       after recruitment quotas for U.S. Volunteers were reached and additional manpower was needed to deal with the deteriorating state of affairs. By the
                       end of 1861 a very confused situation had arisen in that different rules were governing the individual units&#45;some companies were being mustered in
                       on condition that they serve only in Missouri, while others that were actively serving never actually mustered in. In addition, there were units that
                       had been formed without any underlying legal authority whatsoever. To resolve matters the Union command commenced disbanding these organizations in
                       December, while a few had already <em>&#34;relieved themselves from duty,&#34;</em> to provide for their families after coming to the realization there was no chance
                       of obtaining payment for their services. With the Confederate-supporting state government having been ousted from the capital by the summer of 1861,
                       the newly installed Unionist government began assuming responsibility for local defense by creating several organizations to fill the niche served by
                       the Home Guard, including the Six-month Militia in late 1861 and the Enrolled Missouri Militia in mid-1862.</p>
                       
                       <p><strong>2. Six-Month Militia 1861</strong></p>
                       <p>In the face of Federal control over community defense in Missouri and the structural deficiencies associated with the Home Guard, on August 24,
                       1861, the newly installed Unionist governor of Missouri, Hamilton Gamble, issued a proclamation calling into service 42,000 militia <em>&#34;to protect
                       the lives and property of the citizens of the State.&#34;</em> Falling far short of its goals, just over 6,000 men signed up for six-month enlistments
                       into five regiments, eleven battalions, and ten independent companies in the following weeks. Assuming the primary role in local defense from the
                       disbanding Home Guard, the Six-month Militia performed duty primarily in <em>&#34;scouring their counties in search of rebel camps and rendezvous, and
                       acting as scouts and guides to the various bodies of volunteers then in the State.&#34;</em> After a few months the great expense in maintaining this
                       force was deemed to be without a corresponding benefit and the governor ordered it dismantled in January 1862. Its duties were subsequently filled
                       in large part by the Missouri State Militia that was being brought into existence at this time.</p>
                       
                       <p><strong>3. Missouri State Militia 1861-1865</strong></p>
                       <p>Coming to grips with the financial realities of fielding large numbers of men to defend the state, Governor Hamilton Gamble developed a plan that
                       shifted the cost to the national government while at the same time allowing him to maintain personal control of the force himself. Meeting with
                       President Abraham Lincoln in the fall of 1861, an agreement was finalized on November 6 wherein a force called the Missouri State Militia was
                       created that was <em>&#34;armed, equipped, clothed, subsisted, transported, and paid by the United States,&#34;</em> but at the same time was not subjected to
                       duty outside of Missouri except in <em>&#34;the immediate defense of the State.&#34;</em> Orders were issued out of the War Department the next day
                       formalizing this agreement, which was further sanctioned by an act of Congress. Gamble appointed the field officers of this organization, and had the
                       power to remove them at his discretion. The MSM leadership reported to the senior U.S. military officers in the state, who were also given commissions
                       in the MSM to bridge a military chain of command that reached directly to Washington D.C. Consequently the precise nature of this entity, according
                       to President Lincoln, was that it <em>&#34;is not strictly either &#39;State troops or &#39United States troops.&#39; It is a mixed character.&#34;</em> Initially
                       not having any constraints on the number of troops it could enlist, within months over 13,000 filled the ranks in 14 regiments (each of which had
                       from eight to ten companies), 3 battalions, 2 independent batteries of artillery, and single independent companies of cavalry, infantry, and sappers
                       and miners. Realizing the enlistments would continue to grow, along with the costs associated with them, in February 1862 Congress limited the number
                       of MSM troops to 10,000. This cap was afterward reached through discharges and attrition, and various units were either disbanded or merged until
                       only nine regiments of cavalry and one regiment of infantry were left. The Missouri State Militia saw hard service during the course of the war and
                       was the primary force that engaged the guerrilla threat in the state. It was also the first line of defense when Confederate regulars made major raids
                       into the state in 1863 and 1864 and suffered heavy losses on those occasions (the 3rd MSM Cavalry played a very critical role in preventing St. Louis
                       from falling to Confederate forces in 1864). According to Governor Gamble, the force was <em>&#34;found very efficient,&#34;</em> and General John M.
                       Schofield (future General-in-Chief of the Army) found that in drill, discipline, and efficiency <em>&#34;these troops will compare favorably with any
                       volunteer troops which I have seen.&#34;</em> Consequently they were made eligible for the same reenlistment bonuses as mainline U.S. Volunteers in 1864,
                       and were granted Federal pensions after the war.</p>
                       
                       <p><strong>4. Enrolled Missouri Militia 1862-1865</strong></p>
                       <p>In the summer of 1862, Confederate Colonel Joseph Porter began a recruiting program behind Federal lines in northeast Missouri. As the Unionist
                       population began to become more and more panicked by the Rebel force in its midst and it became evident the newly-formed Missouri State Militia was
                       stretched too thin to be in all places at all times, the powers-that-be sought a solution. The U.S. Government-funded MSM had quickly reached its
                       cap of 10,000 troops, so additional manpower could not be brought into the field at Federal expense. At the same time, Missouri&#39;s experience in
                       footing the bill on the ill-fated Six-month Militia had provided a costly lesson to the state government and helped it realize that creating another
                       such force was out of the question. A different solution to addressing the wide-spread guerrilla problem would have to be found. In late July 1862 the
                       plan was unveiled. The solution was not to be had by funding a full&#45;time force that would constantly be in service&#45;instead, the solution was to create
                       a force of part&#45;time citizen soldiers that would only be called up in times of emergency, and only have to be paid during those specific times of
                       call-up. The solution was the Enrolled Missouri Militia. On July 22 Governor Gamble issued an order directing Brigadier General John Schofield to
                       organize this militia. Acting with haste, that same day General Schofield issued his own order directing every able bodied man in the state to report
                       immediately to the nearest military outpost to enroll and be sworn into the new militia organization. The net effect was that tens of thousands of
                       fence-sitting men of military age were brought into the military fold. At the same time, thousands of other fence-sitters that were quietly supporting
                       the South were forced to make a decision whether to serve in a Federal unit, or to flee the state and enlist in the Confederate Army. While many men
                       did pursue the latter course of action, over 52,000 others remained behind to form the militia force that eventually reached 85 regiments, 16
                       battalions, and 33 independent companies. On average, most men in the EMM served only a few weeks of active duty over the course of the next two and
                       a half years. Given the nature of the organization&#45;which naturally included disloyal men, men that would not otherwise have been qualified for service,
                       and men that had little desire to serve&#45;the EMM was destined for controversy. Many of the troops called to duty used their positions for their own
                       financial gain, or to settle personal scores with enemies (prompting occasional references to it in the Union press as being the <em>&#34;Enraged Militia&#34;</em>).
                       Nonetheless the Enrolled Militia did fill a Unionist need by freeing up the MSM and other frontline U.S. troops for duty in the field while it
                       conducted local patrols and garrisoned towns. Veterans of the EMM were not eligible for Federal pensions after the conclusion of the war.</p>
                       
                       <p><strong>5. Provisional Enrolled Missouri Militia 1863-1865</strong></p>
                       <p>By early 1863, with the temporary abatement of the guerrilla crisis it was decided that the bulk of the EMM companies in active service would be
                       relieved of duty and the men sent home to resume civilian pursuits. In their place an offshoot of the EMM was created with the object to <em>&#34;1)
                       repress any attempt at insurrection; 2) prevent any combinations for rebellion against the Government; and 3) maintain the laws of the State.&#34;</em>
                       (italics from the original) This new force, the Provisional Enrolled Missouri Militia, was formed under the authority of the EMM and the military
                       status of the men that served in it was the same as the original force with the exception that it would be a full&#45;time organization. As the
                       thinking went, a reduced force of full-time troops would be as effective as a larger force of part-time troops. The PEMM began organizing in May 1863
                       by detailing picked men from the individual EMM regiments (this force was most commonly referred to as the <em>&#34;Detailed Militia&#34;</em>). In order that
                       the personnel could concentrate on the job at hand and not have the distractions that marred the original EMM, the troops chosen for the PEMM were
                       those <em>&#34;who could most easily be spared from their ordinary avocations, having but few if any others dependent upon their labor for support&#34;</em>
                       and would be <em>&#34;commanded by judiciously selected officers.&#34;</em> While the state was responsible for paying them, their clothing, camp and garrison
                       equipage, and medical supplies were provided by the United States. Eleven regiments and one independent company were formed, which were placed under
                       the overall command of General Schofield who referred to them as being <em>&#34;a real addition to the effective force in the department.&#34;</em> Because of
                       the nature of their service, veterans of the PEMM were eligible for Federal pensions after the war. The PEMM was marred by self-destructive political
                       infighting between the Conservative Unionist governor, Hamilton Gamble, and large numbers of Radical Unionist troops that were detailed to it. Because
                       of this, most of the regiments were disbanded to prevent them from having any influence over the November 1863 judicial elections. Two regiments
                       remained in service until the end of the conflict after being converted to U.S. Volunteer cavalry regiments in 1864.</p>
                       
                       <p><strong>6. Provisional Enrolled Militia (G.O. #107) 1864-1865</strong></p>
                       <p>Not to be confused with the Provisional Enrolled Missouri Militia. Brought into existence on June 28, 1864, via General Order No. 107 issued by
                       the senior commander of the Department of the Missouri, Major General William S. Rosecrans, this organization was created to address a new wave of
                       guerrilla activity that began overwhelming the state in mid-1864. Commonly referred to as <em>&#34;Order 107 Militia&#34;</em> the organization was intended
                       <em>&#34;to provide for local defense against bands of bushwhackers and other disturbers of the public peace, and for the maintenance of law and order
                       more effectually than could be done by calling out the Enrolled Militia, as well as to engage all good citizens in the work.&#34;</em> This was truly a
                       grass-roots organization as residents of the individual counties were required to hold meetings to choose and organize one or two companies of
                       <em>&#34;about 100 men each, selected for courage, energy, and willingness to serve for the protection of your respective counties.&#34;</em> The men chosen
                       were to be detailed from the Enrolled Militia (although in actual practice volunteers were also accepted) and were to be led by <em>&#34;the best
                       officers selected and recommended by the proper Enrolled Militia colonels and brigadier-generals of the districts in which they belong.&#34;</em> The
                       sixty&#45;two companies that were formed under Order 107 differed from the Provisional Enrolled Missouri Militia in three major respects&#45;they were
                       organized as independent companies as opposed to being but one company in a larger regiment; their enlisted personnel were chosen by county committees
                       as opposed to EMM officers; and their duty was intended to be temporary and local along the lines of the regular EMM, as opposed to permanent and
                       regional as in the PEMM (consequently, unlike the PEMM, veterans of the Provisional Companies were not eligible for post-war Federal pensions).</p>
                       
                       <p><strong>7. Missouri Militia (G.O. #3) 1865</strong></p>
                       <p>In anticipation of the disbanding of the Enrolled Missouri Militia scheduled to take place on March 12, 1865, as well as the ongoing expirations
                       of enlistments of most of the troops in the Missouri State Militia, the present commanding general of the Department of the Missouri, Major General
                       Grenville Dodge, sought to create a replacement force that <em>&#34;would be more effective and available, and at the same time less expensive to the
                       State.&#34;</em> The result was the Missouri Militia, a creation of individual independent companies to be provisioned by the U.S. government and paid by
                       the counties in question and the disloyal citizens that resided therein. On January 30, 1865, the newly installed governor, Thomas Fletcher, caused
                       to be issued General Order #3 providing for the Missouri Militia. Sixty&#45;one companies were formed, with a charge that was more law&#45;enforcement
                       oriented than military. According to the formational order, it was organized for active service <em>&#34;for the purpose of repressing lawlessness and to
                       secure safety of life and property to all good citizens, and to strengthen the hands of legal justice by enabling the officers of the law to execute
                       its processes and judgments.&#34;</em> In April the state&#39;s civil authority created a second Missouri Militia organization that was to be based on
                       regiments (as stated, the present MM was based on independent companies), causing two different Missouri Militias to be operating at the same time.
                       With the Confederate surrender at Appomattox a few days later and the general cessation of hostilities in the following weeks, the Order #3 Missouri
                       Militia quickly ran into insurmountable funding problems. In late June and early July Governor Fletcher caused to be issued a series of orders
                       dismantling it, <em>&#34;in consequence of the refusal of the United States Government to issue subsistence. . . . and the inability, for want of
                       appropriations, of the State to subsist them, and the necessity for employing that class of troops no longer existing. . . .&#34;</em></p>
                       
                       <p><strong>8. Missouri Militia (State Convention) 1865-late 19th century</strong></p>
                       <p>In the waning days of the war the State Convention adopted an ordinance requiring a state militia force to organize into platoons, companies, regiments, and brigades
                       (marking a shift from creation by military fiat to creation by civil authority). Created on April 8, 1865, this version of the Missouri Militia
                       survived long after hostilities finally ended and was the primary force that addressed the lawless element that engulfed post-war Missouri. Eighty&#39;four
                       regiments and six battalions were formed.</p>
